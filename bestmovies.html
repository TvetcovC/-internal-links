                <h3 align="right">40) All I Can Say</h3>
                <p align="justify">Shannon Hoon died much too young when, on October 21, 1995, the 28-year-old Blind Melon singer suffered a fatal drug
                overdose on his tour bus. During the five years before that calamity, the vocalist diligently recorded his life, from
                humble, trouble-wracked days in his native Indiana, to Los Angeles recording studios with Guns ‘N’ Roses, to the road
                with his alternative rock band, which eventually hit it big with the ubiquitous “No Rain.” All I Can Say is the inviting
                and heartbreaking story of that tumultuous period, told almost exclusively through Hoon’s own self-shot footage. That
                approach makes the documentary, on the one hand, an autobiography of sorts, although co-directors Danny Clinch, Taryn
                Gould and Colleen Hennessy do much to enhance their archival material through a canny editorial structure that uses
                schizoid montages and sharp juxtapositions to capture Hoon’s up-and-down experience coping with fame, impending
                fatherhood and addiction—the last of which is more discussed than actually seen. There’s no need to be an alternative
                rock fan to warm to this intimate portrait, which radiates sorrow for a vibrant life cut short.</p>

                <h3>39) Bad Education</h3>
                <p align="justify">Using cheery smiles and go-getter glares to conceal profound depths of resentment, ambition and greed, Hugh Jackman
                gives the performance of his career as Roslyn, Long Island public school superintendent Dr. Frank Tassone in Bad
                Education. A dramatic account of the historic embezzlement scandal that engulfed Tassone and his colleagues – most
                notably, assistant superintendent Pam Gluckin (Allison Janney) – Cory Finley’s film (based on Robert Kolker’s New York
                Magazine article) is a ruthlessly efficient and even-keeled affair about the intense pressures of suburban academia,
                where educational-ranking achievements and college acceptance rates are intimately intertwined with real-estate prices.
                The director lays out the myriad forces at play in this ostensibly picture-perfect milieu in exacting detail, and his
                preference for longer takes means that the focus remains squarely on his performers. That, in turn, allows the HBO
                feature to rest on the sturdy shoulders of Jackman, who never resorts to caricature in embodying Tassone as a discontent
                striver whose eagerness for validation dovetailed with his lifelong deceptiveness, to disastrous ends.</p>

                <h3>38) The Trip to Greece</h3>
                <p align="justify">Steve Coogan and Rob Brydon follow the path first traversed by Odysseus in The Trip To Greece, once again engaging in
                the witty banter and dueling celebrity impressions that have become the hallmark of this Michael Winterbottom-stewarded
                comedy series. For this fourth and ostensibly final installment, the bickering couple (Coogan arrogant and
                condescending; Brydon cheery and patient) enjoy fine meals and show off their imitative vocal skills, here highlighted
                by Coogan doing a pitch-perfect Ray Winstone as King Henry VIII. In keeping with its predecessors, the duo’s latest
                colors its humor with a strain of wistful regret rooted in their thorny feelings about transitioning into middle age.
                Anxiety about mortality turns out to be more pronounced than ever, particularly via Coogan’s Ingmar Bergman-esque dream
                sequence, which is related to dismay over his father’s failing health. Nonetheless, the alternately combative and chummy
                English pair remain in fine, funny form, and their swan song proves to be their most substantive collaboration since
                their maiden outing.</p>

                <h3 align="right">37) Lost Girls</h3>
                <p align="justify">The true story of a mother’s search for her missing child, Netflix’s Lost Girls is a clear-eyed and moving expose about
                the many ways in which troubled young women are let down by parents, police and society at large. Using Robert Kolker’s
                book as her source, director Liz Garbus recounts Mari Gilbert’s (Amy Ryan) efforts to find her oldest daughter Shannan,
                a prostitute, after she vanished following a house call in a gated Long Island community. At every turn, what Mari
                discovers is a lack of urgency about, if not outright indifference to, her daughter’s disappearance, even after other
                bodies are found in the very same area. Ryan’s powerhouse performance as the fiercely determined Mari is the nucleus of
                this dispiritingly bleak tale, in which there are few concrete answers to be found, but plenty of blame to pass around.
                That Garbus doesn’t let Mari off the hook for her own mistakes, while nonetheless casting a reproachful gaze at the
                individual and systemic failings that allow such crimes to occur – and go unsolved – only strengthens her cinematic case
                for compassion and togetherness as the bulwark against tragedy.</p>
